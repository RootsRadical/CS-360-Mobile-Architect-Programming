Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The goal of the project was to create simplistic database tracking application that allowed you to apply CRUD methods and be alerted as to when your inventory is low.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A necessary screen was first the login screen with the option to create an account. after that we needed a screen that showed what you had in stock as a company. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I approach this application by trying to create something simple and intuitive. I didn't want my users to have to try hard to figure things out. The goal was to allow them to hit the ground running per se and that is how i approach coding as well. I want my code to be simple and readable, so that anyone can understand what I was looking to accomplish.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

Testing your code is important because you need to know if it works and if there are any pitfalls. You might have an idea in your head that just might not work in practice. Testing allows you to see those things before you launch your application.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I think I really had to dig deep and do my research when it came to creating the java code for this application. I understood the database side and I was getting the hang of the xml files and how to adjust that. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I'm not entirely sure to be honest. This was my first ever mobile app and I tried my best to tie it all together.
